This project is still under preparation. It will be more relevant when reaching 1.0 release when pre-built binaries will become available. It will become easier to use at version 1.1 when deployment tools will be available. Check [development roadmap](https://github.com/pal1000/swiftshader-dist-win/blob/master/roadmap.md) for detailed progress.
